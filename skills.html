        <h3>C/C++</h3>
        <p>My main language is C++, most of the programs I make are in C++.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3>Algorithms & Data Structures</h3>
        <p>Thinking of a solution to an algorithmic problem whether for real life or competitions quickly is my main skill. I utilize graph algorithms, advanced data structures, string algorithms, and more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>I have done a few cool projects in python, and I am comfortable writing in it (average). <br>*I plan to improve a lot in data science and python in the next 1-2 years*.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h3>Math</h3>
        <p>I can solve puzzles and prove the solution. Strategic and creative thinking are my strongest side. I also know very well calculus & discrete math from high school & university, though I don't really enjoy "canned" school math because you need to practice the exact same trivial problem 200 times to make less mistakes on the exam which is boring.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>Unlike many useless things we learn in school, HTML & CSS are a useful skill to have. I can display something that I like, for example this page. I learned this skill primarily in school & from auditory exercises.
