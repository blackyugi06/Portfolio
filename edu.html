        <h1>Education Journey</h1>
        <p style="padding: 10px;">I was born and raised in Skopje. During primary school, I mostly played football and video games. I started high school at Nova International Schools. I spent my first two years fully dedicated to school-related work, projects, research camps, and more. I took all the hardest classes, including AP Calculus and AP Computer Science in my sophomore year, along with IB MYP Extended Math and five additional subjects.

            I can confidently say that I was the best student in the school. Most of my teachers were amazing, and we had a great relationship. However, I felt like I lacked a sense of purpose. I needed something that genuinely excited me to grow and improve — not just chase school grades.

            Eventually, I learned that programming competitions existed in Macedonia, so I decided to transfer to Yahya Kemal College, a school known for students who excel at competitions. I realized that in every country, there are only a few students who truly go beyond what is taught in school — these are the ones who represent their countries at international olympiads.

            I wanted to be one of them. Although many people told me it was foolish to give up my IB diploma (since my new school didn’t offer it) and that I most likely wouldn’t achieve what I was aiming for since I had very little time to prepare, I didn’t really care. Fortunately, I did qualify for the IOI in 3rd year of high school(almost won a medal!), and along the way, I met some of my closest friends — both nationally and internationally. Some of the best stories and funniest memories were from IOI and competing. In 4th year I decided not to go for personal reasons. I am now studying at the Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering in Skopje, and I continue to pursue algorithms and programming independently. Converting to data science training through kaggle is on my to-do list as well. My only regret is not starting in 5th grade elementary school instead of 3rd grade high school, but I am happy with the memories I made nonetheless.</p>
